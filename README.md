## 🚀 About Me

**Full-Stack Software Developer** with **4+ years of hands-on experience** (since March 2022) building high-performance, scalable web applications using modern JavaScript frameworks. Specialized in **React.js** and **Vue.js**, with expertise in **Node.js** backend development and growing proficiency in **Rust** for systems programming.

Currently working at **Chandaria Industries Limited** as an **MIS Assistant & Software Developer**, where I architect and deploy enterprise-grade applications serving 100+ users. In just 7 months, I've built two major production systems: a **GatePass Management System** (Vue.js 3 + React Native) and a **Papermill Reel Tracking System** (React + Socket.IO).

I'm passionate about clean code architecture, responsive design, and creating intuitive user experiences that drive business impact. Proven track record delivering projects in fully remote, asynchronous environments with international clients.

**Key Strengths:** React.js • Vue.js 3 • Node.js • TypeScript • REST/gRPC APIs • PostgreSQL • Responsive Design • CI/CD • Remote Collaboration
